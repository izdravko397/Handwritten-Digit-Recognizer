# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project demonstrates a simple neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.  
It uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a model that classifies 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9).

- ðŸ“š **Dataset:** 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images from MNIST.
- ðŸ§  **Model:** A fully connected neural network (Flatten + Dense layers) with dropout for regularization.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accuracy:** Achieves around 97â€“98% test accuracy.
- ðŸ’¾ **Saved Model:** The trained model is saved in the repository and can be reloaded anytime.

This project is great for demonstrating how a basic neural network can learn to recognize patterns in images.

## Why it's interesting

This project is a classic demonstration of how deep learning can recognize visual patterns. Even with a simple architecture, the model can accurately read digits written by different people.

Itâ€™s a great starting point for experimenting with more advanced architectures or different datasets.
